        <h2 id="content">Swedish</h2>
        <p id="deep"></p>
        <p>
          Our Swedish Massage is recommended for clients who are not used to
          massages, have an abundance of stress and for others who are sensitive
          to touch. It involves soft, long, kneading strokes, as well as light,
          rhythmic, tapping strokes, on topmost layers of muscles. This is also
          combined with movement of the joints. By relieving muscle tension,
          Swedish therapy can be both relaxing and energizing.
        </p>

        <p id="thai"></p>
        <h2 id="content">Deep Tissue</h2>
        <p>
          Our Deep Tissue Massage is distinguished by the increased amount of
          pressure used by your therapist. This is recommended for clients who
          have chronic muscle soreness of old injuries. This massage may be
          cause pain if the muscle is sensitive to pressure though.
        </p>

        <p id="sports"></p>
        <h2 id="content">Thai</h2>
        <p>
          Our Thai Massage is recommended for clients who are more comfortable
          with a no oil or lotion / clothed massage. Traditional Thai masses
          uses no oils or lotions and the recipient remains clothed during the
          treatment. There is constant body contact between the therapist and
          client, but rather than rubbing on muslces, the body is compressed,
          pulled, stretched and rocked.
        </p>

        <p id="trigger"></p>
        <h2 id="content">Sports</h2>
        <p>
          Our Sports Massage is recommended for clients who have had repeated
          injuries to a muscle or for athletes who need to increase their
          flexibility. Sports massage works deep in the muscles, realigning the
          muscle fibres and connective tissue, and flushing away the toxins.
          Regular sessions will increase joint mobility and flexibility, and
          reduce the risk of injury during exercise.
        </p>

        <p id="aroma"></p>
        <h2 id="content">Trigger-Point</h2>
        <p>
          Our Trigger-Point Massage is recommended for clients have have
          injuries or chronic pain. Trigger-points are areas of tightness in the
          muscle that can cause pain to surrounding areas. Trigger point massage
          therapy is specifically designed to alleviate the source of the pain
          through cycles of isolated pressure and release. In this type of
          massage for trigger point therapy, the recipient actively participates
          through deep breathing as well as identifying the exact location and
          intensity of the discomfort.

        <p id="natal"></p>
        <h2 id="content">Aromatherapy</h2>
        <p>
          Our Aromatherapy Massage is recommended for clients who are stressed,
          sore, or overtired, but would prefer for a lighter touch. The purpose
          of an aromatherapy massage is not so much to physically work out all
          the kinks and sore spots in your body, but to use the restorative
          properties of essential oils to relax and heal your body and mind.
        </p>

          aches, especially in the lower-back. We do not offer Pre-Natal Massage
          services for clients within their first trimester due to the risk of
          birth-complications to the Mother and child. For more information

        <p id="stone"></p>
        <h2 id="content">Chair</h2>
        <p>
          Our Chair Massage is recommended for clients who want to focus on
          their arms and shoulders. The therapist uses lotion or oil to work out
          trigger points, tension, and tight muscles. However, in a chair
          massage, the client is fully clothed and sitting in a specialized
          chair. The massage chair is designed for the client to rest forward
          slightly, with their arms and legs supported.
        </p>

        <p id="menses"></p>
        <h2 id="content">Hot Stone</h2>
        <p>
          Our Hot Stone Massage is recommended for clients looking for an
          increased pressure technique to ease areas of pain. This therapy
          involves the use of smooth, heated stones. The therapist places the
          hot stones on specific points on the client's body and may also hold
          the stones while giving the massage. The localized heat and weight of
          the stones warm and relax muscles, allowing the massage therapist to
          apply deeper pressure to those areas without causing discomfort.
