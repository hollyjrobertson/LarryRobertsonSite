************About Me************
I received my Registered Massage Therapy license in 2003 from the East Texas School of Massage Therapy. I am also a retired Licensed Vocational Nurse of thirty-three years. By connecting these two careers, it provides me the knowledge and skill required to help relieve many of the symptoms that have plagued them for years. As required by the State of Texas Board of Nursing and the Texas Massage Therapy Licensing Program, I continue my education in both fields; striving to enhance my techniques and learn new innovative ways to make my clients feel better. 

I strive to make sure that whatever my clients' needs are, that he/she feels better when leaving than when they arrived. All too often we aim to do things to help our friends and family feel better - pushing our own needs to the back. We need to understand that if our health fails due to poor maintenance, we will be unable to help those we love the most. I will explain and show how just a few minutes a week can enhance you health and in-turn help those in your circle of life. 

At Priority One Massage we want and strive to have our clients feel comfortable and relaxed at all times. We offer a private and peaceful home-like atmosphere, helping our clients to feel safe and at ease. Our private facilities are governed and controlled by state regulations.

Our clients are required to fill-out a simple questionnaire concerning their past and current medical history, their pressure preference, and areas on the body the client wishes to have worked on. This information is necessary for several reasons. First, massage therapy can be restricted due to certain medical conditions and/or allergies. For example: If a client was recently in a car accident, but hasn't been cleared by their primary doctor, per the State of Texas Health Department, a masseuse is forbidden to perform any massage services for them. So the medical history taken by this form is not only necessary, but required by Texas law. Rest assured though, all of this information is kept highly-confidential and secure. As an employee of the medical health field for the last 33 years, I understand and always remain in compliance with HIPAA and Texas law. 


************Services Overview************
We offer a large range of massage services and spa modalities to enhance your health. Different types of massages focus on different parts of the body and healing approaches. Each of our massage types and techniques encompasses rubbing and kneading different parts of the body. The amount of pressure used by the therapist is in conjunction with the needs of the client. 

************Swedish************
Our Swedish Massage is recommended for clients who are not used to massages, have an abundance of stress and for others who are sensitive to touch.It involves soft, long, kneading strokes, as well as light, rhythmic, tapping strokes, on topmost layers of muscles. This is also combined with movement of the joints. By relieving muscle tension, Swedish therapy can be both relaxing and energizing.

Our Deep Tissue Massage is distinguished by the increased amount of pressure used by your therapist. This is recommended for clients who have chronic muscle soreness of old injuries. This massage may be cause pain if the muscle is sensitive to pressure though. 

************Thai************
Our Thai Massage is recommended for clients who are more comfortable with a no oil or lotion / clothed massage. Traditional Thai masses uses no oils or lotions and the recipient remains clothed during the treatment. There is constant body contact between the therapist and client, but rather than rubbing on muslces, the body is compressed, pulled, stretched and rocked. 

************Sports************
Our Sports Massage is recommended for clients who have had repeated injuries to a muscle or for athletes who need to increase their flexibility. Sports massage works deep in the muscles, realigning the muscle fibres and connective tissue, and flushing away the toxins. Regular sessions will increase joint mobility and flexibility, and reduce the risk of injury during exercise.

Our Trigger-Point Massage is recommended for clients have have injuries or chronic pain. Trigger-points are areas of tightness in the muscle that can cause pain to surrounding areas.  Trigger point massage therapy is specifically designed to alleviate the source of the pain through cycles of isolated pressure and release. In this type of massage for trigger point therapy, the recipient actively participates through deep breathing as well as identifying the exact location and intensity of the discomfort.

************Aromatherapy************
Our Aromatherapy Massage is recommended for clients who are stressed, sore, or overtired, but would prefer for a lighter touch. The purpose of an aromatherapy massage is not so much to physically work out all the kinks and sore spots in your body, but to use the restorative properties of essential oils to relax and heal your body and mind.

We do not offer Pre-Natal Massage services for clients within their first trimester due to the risk of birth-complications to the Mother and child.

Our Chair Massage is recommended for clients who want to focus on their arms and shoulders. The therapist uses lotion or oil to work out trigger points, tension, and tight muscles. However, in a chair massage, the client is fully clothed and sitting in a specialized chair. The massage chair is designed for the client to rest forward slightly, with their arms and legs supported.

************Stone************
Our Hot Stone Massage is recommended for clients looking for an increased pressure technique to ease areas of pain. This therapy  involves the use of smooth, heated stones. The  therapist places the hot stones on specific points on the client's body and may also hold the stones while giving the massage. The localized heat and weight of the stones warm and relax muscles, allowing the massage therapist to apply deeper pressure to those areas without causing discomfort.
